## Details

Besides the usual bunch of bug fixes, this release is unusual for a minor release in that we decided to include two major features as well:

* The rectangle packing algorithm, which is finally included, got a major rewrite.
* Port label placement now supports next-to-port labels for outside port labels as well, with some configurability.
